# Telecom-Data-Analysis
Telecom Data Analysis with Power BI

A comprehensive Power BI project focused on analyzing key metrics in the telecommunications industry. Gain insights into customer behavior, network performance, and revenue trends through interactive dashboards.

#Feature-Oriented
Interactive Telecom Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository presents a robust Power BI solution for in-depth telecom data analysis. Explore critical KPIs such as customer churn, ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), call patterns, network utilization, and service adoption through dynamic and insightful visualizations.

#Key Features:

Customer Churn Analysis: Identify factors leading to customer attrition and retention strategies.

Revenue Performance Tracking: Monitor revenue streams, ARPU, and plan performance.

Network Usage Insights: Visualize data consumption, call volumes, and network health.

Geographical Analysis: Understand performance variations across different regions.

Interactive Dashboards: Utilize slicers and filters for granular data exploration.

Clear & Actionable Insights: Designed for stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

#Problem/Solution Focused
Unlocking Insights: Telecom Data Analysis for Strategic Decision-Making (Power BI)

The telecommunications sector generates vast amounts of data. This project leverages Power BI to transform raw telecom data into actionable intelligence. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage, and operational metrics, this solution helps identify challenges (e.g., customer churn, declining revenue) and uncovers opportunities for business growth and improved customer satisfaction.

#Technical & Detailed
Telecom Analytics Hub: Power BI Data Model & Dashboard

This GitHub repository showcases a complete telecom data analysis project built with Microsoft Power BI. It includes:

Data Model: A well-structured star schema (or snowflake schema, if applicable) optimized for performance and analytical flexibility, demonstrating robust ETL processes (Power Query) and relationship management.

DAX Measures: Custom-calculated measures (DAX) for key telecom KPIs such as Churn Rate, ARPU, Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), Call Completion Rate, and more.

Interactive Dashboards: Multi-page Power BI reports providing comprehensive visualizations of:

Customer Segmentation & Churn Prediction

Service Adoption & Usage Patterns

Revenue & Profitability Analysis

Network Performance & Quality of Service (QoS)

Geographical Distribution of Customers and Issues

Source Data (if applicable): [Mention if you include sample data or data source types, e.g., "Sample CSV files" or "Connection to SQL Database"].

Technologies Used: Power BI Desktop (Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX), [Optional: SQL Server, Excel, etc. for data preparation].
